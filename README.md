# HR_Dataset
Analyses the HR Dataset in order to draw meaningful insights from it. 
The HR Dataset table contains information on various employee attributes such as attrition, job satisfaction, job role, employee departments, employee educational fields, employee 
gender, job roles, marital status, etc, which can be used to analyze factors affecting employee performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions for improving employee 
engagement and retention strategies.

# My analysis entailed the following;
- Created a new table called attrition_count, with a conditional statement.
- Created a new measure for attrition rate.
- Created a new measure for active employees.
- Created a dashboard which analyses employee performance, job satisfaction ratings, employee number based on Department and attrition, etc.
